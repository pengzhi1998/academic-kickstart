1. Modified ACS files to create VizDoom Mazes with required behaviors: discretized agent’s actions and built APIs for interaction.
2. Implemented Active Neural Localizer with A3C algorithm in the created mazes based on Bayesian Filter.
3. Adjusted the Perception Model in 3D environment (used distances as inputs rather than images) and facilitated the system’s **practical application**.
