# Background
China has thousands of miles of lakes and rivers, but it is still a country that is extremely short of
water. More than two-third of cities have inadequate
water supplies. Water pollution is the chief culprit for that. Facing with such
a severe water pollution, we came up with an economical solution to deal with that -- the surface cleaner
, which is called **Xcavenger**. <br>

# Design
We designed a small catamaran which could capture the floating trash and 3D printed it. By differentiating
the speed of two motors, the direction of the surface robot could be changed easily. <br>

After tests, we proposed future improvements: <br>
- Improve its flexibility and maneuverability. <br>
- Apply object detection and localization, automate the task. <br>
I cooperated with Qizhou Wang, Yue Zhao. We drafted the business plan for this project. (not a real one,
just a practice)
