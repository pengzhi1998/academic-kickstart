# Overview
Based on gate-level circuit design, we implemented a 32 bits CPU in Verilog. It contains the main parts of a fully
functional pipelined CPU. Then we embedded deep pipeline into the ALU. <br>
We ran 100 8-point
FFT algorithm on it, And tested the project on FPGA (We used Basys, which is specifically designed for Vivado Design Suite). It is proved to be efficient 
and reliable. <br>
