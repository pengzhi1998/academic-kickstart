1. Built a computer mainframe case in **Flotherm**. Adjusted the structure of the whole case and the parameters of the accessories according to thermodynamic theory and simulation results; kept the temperature of three monitored points below 90 â„ƒ.
2. Proposed an original design of the thermal conductivity structure; the dissipation efficiency was improved.

The report (Chinese version) for this project is [here](./Computer Case Dissipation.pdf).
