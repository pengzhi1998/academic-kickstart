This project simulated the dissipation of the computer case based on **Flotherm**. I explored 
the relationship between heat dissipation and spread, convection and radiation.
Then, by optimizing the structure (the position of the elements, the number, thickness of fins, and
the position of the fans), I kept the temperature of the monitored points below 70 and 87 degrees Celsius.
<br>
Meanwhile, I added a wind deflector which could help keep the temperature under 90 degrees Celsius even
the frequency of the big fan was limited. <br>
The report (Chinese version) for this project is [here](./Computer Case Dissipation.pdf).
