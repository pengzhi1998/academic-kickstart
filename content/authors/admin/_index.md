Hi there, thank you for visiting my webpage!<br>
I'm Pengzhi, a senior undergraduate from UESTC. As a student who is majoring in EECS, 
I'd like to devote myself to the research on robotics as well as deep reinforcement learning. I'm 
now an undergraduate research assistant at [DIG Lab](http://dig.uestc.cn/?page_id=46) under 
Professor [Changsheng Li](http://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/lizhangsheng/en/index.htm). <br> 
I'm fond of handcrafting, swimming, photography, biking, diving and movies.<br>
