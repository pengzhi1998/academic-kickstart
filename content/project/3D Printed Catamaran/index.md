# Background
China has thousands of miles of lakes and rivers, but it is still a country that is extremely short of
water. More than two-third of cities have inadequate
water supplies. Water pollution is the chief culprit for that. Facing with such
a severe water pollution, we came up with an economical solution to deal with that -- the surface cleaner
, which is called **Xcavenger**.
